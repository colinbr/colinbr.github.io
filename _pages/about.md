Hi, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [UBC Linguistics](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/).

I received my PhD from the [Department of Linguistics at UCLA](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/).

I am interested in the interaction between syntax, semantics, and morphology. The empirical basis of my research comes from novel fieldwork on understudied languages, primarily [Sm'algyax](https://www.firstvoices.com/smalgyax) and [Gitksan](https://www.firstvoices.com/gitsenimx) (Tsimshianic, Canada/USA) and more recently, [Mam](https://aprende.guatemala.com/cultura-guatemalteca/etnias/palabras-idioma-mam-guatemala/) (Mayan, Guatemala/Mexico).

**Research topics:** morphosyntax of A′-movement, semantics of non-canonical questions, and linearization of sentential clitics.
